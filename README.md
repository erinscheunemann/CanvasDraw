# CanvasDraw
A little page I made in HTML and JS that uses the canvas element combined with JS event listeners to allow people to draw on a webpage.

Added layer functionality to canvas.

**NEW**:
- User can add layers to canvas by clicking the add layer button.
- User can pick which layer they want to draw on by clicking the radio button next to the disired layer.
- User can hide and unhide layers by clicking the checkbox next to the disired layer.
- Clear and Save Image buttons were moved to be on top of the drawing canvas rather than underneath it. (this is temporary)

**BUGS** (or *less appreciated* features...):
- Clear button now only clears the background layer rather than the whole drawing.
- Save button now only downloads layer selected rather than the whole drawing.

**TODO**: 
- Add eraser.
- Add functionality to delete layers.
- Fix clear and save functionalities.
- Add styling...
